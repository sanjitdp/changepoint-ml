# changepoint-ml
Experiments on the use of deep learning models for changepoint detection.

## Usage

Run `source setup.sh` from the root directory before running any Python scripts in this repository. This installs all requirements needed and sets the `PYTHONPATH` for relative imports.

Then, you can run any of the experiments using `python3 src/experiments/<insert experiment here>` from the root directory.
